# Finding the UID codes
In order to change up the code, you first need to know what your tag's UID is.

For this, we use the program, *UID_identification*, you will find this [here](UID_identification.ino).

Running this code after uploading, we get the UID codes in the output screen, when the UID tags are brought close into proximity.
Store these codes somewhere in your system, as we will be needing them as the codes which are used to identify the tag's accessability.
